Keywords: Polymer science; phase separation; nanofillers; localization; partitioning; percolation; surface energy
This code uses the Owens-Wendt theory to calculate surface energies of polymers and fillers from contact angle measurements and predict phase separation and nanofiller localization based on interfacial tensions.
